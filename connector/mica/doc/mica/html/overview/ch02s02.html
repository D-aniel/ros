      conduits for messages. These messages are requests that do things such
      as request that an object be written to the blackboard, or that an agent
      be informed that a newly created mob.</p><p>The diagram shows two agents connected to one blackboard.
      Typically, there would be more than two agents connected, but two are
      the minimum number for any interesting application. Agents and
      blackboards do not communicate directly, but through a transport layer.
      This allows implementations of MICA to use different transport layers.
      For example, some possible transport layers are: local function calls,
      XML over a TCP/IP connection, some proprietary encrypted protocol, or
      ASCII messages over Bluetooth. For each one of these, a pair of classes
      -- an agent transport and a blackboard transport -- need to be
      developed. Agents talk to the Agent Transport layer through method
      calls; and likewise for the Blackboard.</p><p>The advantage of doing things in this way is that it gives a lot
      of flexibility in the domain MICA can be applied to; and allows
      developers to write agents that do not need to be aware of the
      underlying transport layer.</p><p>In order to clarify how requests are passed, consider what happens
      when Agent 1 writes a mob to the blackboard, which is of type
      <code class="classname">Message</code>. Also assume that Agent 2 has registered
      for any mobs whose type is <code class="classname">Message</code>. Agent 1 would
      create the mob and call an appropriate method in its agent transport.
      The agent transport would deliver it to the blackboard transport (using
      whatever transport medium was appropriate). The blackboard transport
      would do two things: firstly, it would give a name to the mob; say
      <code class="classname">Message_0</code>, and inform Agent 1 -- through Agent
      1's transport -- of the new mob's name. Secondly, since Agent 2 was
      registered for mobs of type <code class="classname">Message</code>, the
      blackboard would send a message to Agent 2's transport, that there was a
      new mob called <code class="classname">Message_0</code> with certain slots.
      Agent 2's transport would then call a method in Agent 2 to handle the
      newly arrived Mob.</p><p>Note the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Neither Agent 1 nor Agent 2 are explicitly aware of one
          another.</p></li><li><p>Many different agents can register for mobs of a given type.
          There could be a dozen agents connected to the blackboard, and if
          six of them were registered for <code class="classname">Message</code>s,
          then all six of them would get it.</p></li><li><p>The arrows are "two way" arrows. At times the blackboard will
          initiate communication with an agent, and at other times, it will be
          the other way around.</p></li><li><p>Agents can register for mobs of any type, and they will be
          informed if mobs of that type or any sub-type are written to the
          blackboard. For example, if <code class="classname">ShortMessage</code> was
          a subtype of <code class="classname">Message</code>, and someone wrote a mob
          of type <code class="classname">ShortMessage</code> to the blackboard, Agent
          2 would still be informed.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 2. The MICA Design </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 3. Installing and running MICA</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
