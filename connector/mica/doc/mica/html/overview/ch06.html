    applications using MICA have several clients involved in the process. In
    this chapter we discuss the mail reading application, which involves four
    different MICA clients: a learning agent, an e-mail agent, a user
    interaction agent, a natural language processing agent and a debug
    agent.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp18431448"></a>A scenario</h2></div></div></div><p>Imagine that in 2006, a user (say Aki) has the WhizBang 3000 PDA.
      The user carries it around with him everywhere. The PDA has some pretty
      cool technology on board. In particular, it has GPS, speech recognition
      and speech synthesis. It also interacts with sensors in the environment
      that let it know things like: the ambient noise level, whether the user
      is at home, in the car, or in the office, and what other people are
      around.</p><p>One funny thing about the WhizBang is that it does not have a
      screen, or a microphone, or even a speaker. Instead, it is just a small
      box that Aki carries in his briefcase. It knows how to communicate with
      its environment, so will use the car's speaker and microphone if it has
      one, and the desktop computer's screen if Aki is in the office or even
      the Bluetooth headset that Aki sometimes wears.</p><p>Now, since the PDA is so smart: the device can be used in the car,
      at home or in the office. However, one issue is to learn what modes the
      user prefers to use, depending on these factors. For example, if Aki
      receives e-mail, should it be read aloud to him using the car's
      speakers, or displayed using the in-dash LCD?</p><p>Ideally, we'd like the WhizBang to learn what Aki likes to do. It
      will learn, for example, that if Aki is in the car and it's not noisy,
      then it should read the e-mail out loud. But, if Aki's in the office, it
      should display them on his monitor.</p><p>In this chapter, we mock up some of the infrastructure, and show
      how such an application could be implemented.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 5. A simple client: SharedPad </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Cast of characters</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
