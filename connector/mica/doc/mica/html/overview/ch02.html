      interplay and coordination that makes it useful. There are really only
      three basic entities used in the MICA design:</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp14959536"></a>The Blackboard</h3></div></div></div><p>The blackboard is the core of MICA. An analogy can be made in
        the case of the blackboard to the old switches that used to be
        employed to handle telephone calls. The blackboard is similar to a
        switch with memory -- facts can also be stored on the blackboard. But
        all interactions between agents flow through the blackboard, in much
        the same way that all phone calls in a town go through a
        switch.</p><p>Much of the power of the blackboard comes from its ability to
        allow many agents to share information. It is expected, that in use,
        there would be one blackboard for each person. All agents and services
        related to that user would execute through the blackboard. It is also
        expected that forum blackboards, for groups of individuals, could also
        be created.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp14961176"></a>Agents</h3></div></div></div><p>Agents are entities that wish to access and contribute to the
        information on the blackboard. As previously mentioed, there are
        several types of agents, but to the blackboard, they all look the
        same.</p><p>Agents take many shapes and forms. It may be a complex GUI
        running on a person's desktop computer, or it may be a proxy for an
        incoming call over the phone system. It may even be a physical device.
        It may be autonomous, with full reasoning and deliberative
        capabilities, or it may be a simple "time" agent, which writes "time"
        objects to the blackboard every ten seconds.</p><p>Agents <span class="emphasis"><em>connect</em></span> to the blackboard. Once
        connected, clients can do several things: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Write something to the blackboard.</p></li><li><p>Read something from the blackboard.</p></li><li><p>Query objects on the blackboard.</p></li><li><p>Register interests for new things written on the
              blackboard. When a new thing -- of interest to the agent -- is
              written to the blackboard, the agent is informed of its
              arrival.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp14965016"></a>MICA Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>MICA Objects (or <span class="emphasis"><em>mobs</em></span> for short) are the
        basic unit of information in MICA. Mobs are the things that clients
        actually read and write from the blackboard.</p><p>Mobs are similar to objects in an object-oriented programming
        language. They have the following characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Name:</em></span> Each mob has a name, which is
            unique. Mobs are named when they are first written to the
            blackboard. The name is a string.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Type:</em></span> Each mob has a type. Much like an
            object-oriented programming language, types can inherit from one
            another. MICA's type system is discussed in greater detail
            later.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Slots:</em></span> Slots are similar to fields in
            object-oriented oriented programming; with one small exception:
            slots can have a list of values associated with them. Each slot
            has a name, and a list of values associated with it.</p></li></ul></div><p>Typically, each type has one or more slots associated with it.
        Subtypes will typically have the slots of the base type, but will
        typically have additional slots.</p><p>A simple example of a mob is the
        <code class="methodname">sharedPadLine</code> type used in the sharedPad demo
        (which is discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. A simple client: SharedPad">Chapter 5</a>). It has four
        slots for each of the properties of a line: <code class="classname">oldX, oldY,
        newX, newY</code>. In this case, each slot only has a single
        value. A subtype might be <code class="classname">colouredPadLine</code> that
        in addition to the slots for a <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code>
        above, also has a slot <code class="classname">colour</code> to describe the
        colour of the line.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The manual </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Putting the pieces together</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
