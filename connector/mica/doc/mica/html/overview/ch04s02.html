        communication in MICA. As previously mentioned, each Mob has a name, a
        type and a set of slots that define it. Let's have a look at two real
        Mobs (as output by its <code class="function">toString()</code> method).</p><div class="figure"><a name="simplemob"></a><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">Mob sharedPadLine_103 of type sharedPadLine has slots:

        values. The current implementation allows only Strings to be stored in
        slots, but this is still a very flexible representation. For example,
        references to other mobs and complex data structures can be
        constructed using slots that contain references to other Mobs.
        Similarly, binary data can be stored using base-64 encoding.</p><p>The methods for mobs are consequently related to constructing a
        Mob. Basically, there are several families of methods. The complete
        documentation can be found in the java documentation.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Constructors:</em></span> The typical constructor
            used to make a Mob is the <code class="methodname">Mob(String
            mobType)</code> method. This creates a new Mob of the
            specified type, but with an undefined name and no slots.
            Typically, the Mob has no name until a name is actually given to
            the Mob by writing it on the blackboard.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Setting up slots:</em></span> There are a number of
            functions to set up slots. <code class="methodname">setSlot(String slotName,
            List slotValues)</code> allows you to set up a slot with all
            of its values, while <code class="methodname">addSlot(String slotName, String
            slotValue)</code> allows you to add a new value to a slot.
            <code class="methodname">addEmptySlot(String slotName)</code> allows you
            to set up a slot that has no values in it.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Getting values from slots:</em></span> There are
            two primary methods for getting values from slots:
            <code class="methodname">getSlot(String slotName)</code> gets all the
            list of values for a slot, but since there is a very common case
            where the list contain a single value, there is also the
            <code class="methodname">getSlot1(Strong slotName)</code> which returns a
            single String, rather than an entire list. To get a slot value as
            an integer, use <code class="methodname">getSlot1AsInt(String
            slotName)</code>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp18340600"></a>Transience</h4></div></div></div><p>On occassion, you want to use MICA merely as a traditional
          publish/subscribe mechanism, i.e. you do not want to save the mob
          you are writing on the blackboard, you just want that mov delivered
          to anyone who is interested. Such mobs can be labelled as transient.
          Transient mobs are not stored on the blackboard, but other agents
          interested in the mobs are notified. To mark a mob as transient, use
          the <code class="methodname">makeTransient()</code> method.</p><p>Note that as of Mica 2.0, transience can also be defined using
          the type manager. If a type is specified in this way, the blackboard
          will ensure that all Mobs of that type are transient, so agents
          creating these mobs are not required to do so.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp18342312"></a>Reserved slot names</h4></div></div></div><p>The following slot names are reserved and are used by the
          system: <code class="classname">creator, creationTime, deleter,
          deletionTime</code> and <code class="classname">persistence</code>.
          Setting these slot names can lead to unexpected events and should be
          avoided.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp18343592"></a><code class="classname">unsw.cse.mica.agent.AgentTransport</code></h3></div></div></div><p><code class="classname">AgentTransport</code> is an interface that
        represents a connection to the blackboard. As such, the
        <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code> is the only "view" that the
        agent actually gets of the blackboard. For this reason, the
        <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code> encapsulates all the
        functionality of the board. Whenever an agent wants to communicate
        with the blackboard it does so through the agent transport. Similarly,
        whenever the agent transport receives information about a new mob,
        this is passed from the agent transport to the agent.</p><p>Because the <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code> is a proxy for
        the blackboard, all its methods are basically proxy commands that are
        forwarded to the blackboard. These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Connection commands:</em></span>
            <code class="methodname">connect(String agentName)</code> and
            <code class="methodname">disconnect()</code> are used to connect to the
            blackboard. <code class="methodname">connect()</code> returns the agent
            name that was given to the agent. The agent can request a
            particular name, but this may not be granted since another agent
            with this name may already exist.
            <code class="methodname">disconnect()</code> obviously disconnects from
            the blackboard.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Getting type information from the
            blackboard:</em></span> Agents can access the blackboard's type
            manager using the
            <code class="code"><code class="methodname">getTypeManager()</code></code>
            command.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Registering and unregistering:</em></span>
            Registering is the way that you let the blackboard know that you
            are interested in objects of a particular type. For instance, if
            an agent is interested in lines, it registers for
            <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code> mobs. Whenever a
            <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code> mob is written to the
            blackboard, the agent is sent a copy of the new mob. To register,
            the <code class="methodname">register(String mobType)</code> can be used.
            Similarly, if an agent is no longer interested in
            <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code>s anymore, it unregisters with
            <code class="methodname">unregister(String mobType)</code></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Writing things on the blackboard</em></span>: To
            write on the blackboard, <code class="methodname">writeMob(Mob m)</code>
            can be used. <code class="methodname">writeMob</code> returns the name
            that the object is finally given. The blackboard then handles the
            forwarding of this message to anyone who is interested -- the
            agent need not concern itself with how the information is
            distributed.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Deleting mobs from the blackboard</em></span>:
            <code class="methodname">deleteMob(String mobName)</code> can be used to
            delete information from the blackboard. However, this should be
            done very carefully, since other mobs may refer to the mob.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Getting mob information from the
            blackboard</em></span>: To retrieve information from the
            blackboard, one can use <code class="methodname">readMob(String
            mobName)</code> if the name of the mob is known or
            <code class="methodname">mobSearch(String micaQuery)</code> if a mob with
            particular properties is sought. For a description of the query
            language, see <a class="xref" href="ch04s05.html#sect.micaql" title="The MICA query language">the section called &#8220;The MICA query language&#8221;</a>.
            <code class="methodname">mobSearch</code> will return all mobs that have
            the desired properties.</p></li></ul></div><p><code class="classname">Mica V2 provides two primary implementations of the
        AgentTransport interface:</code></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>LocalAgentTranport provides a direct programmatic connection

            that this implementation has not been thoroughly tested.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><code class="classname">CompoundTransport</code> combines a
            connection type (<code class="classname">AgentConnection</code>) with a
            protocol (<code class="classname">AgentProtocol</code>) to create a
            versatile component-based transport system. Currently available
            connection types are <code class="classname">LocalAgentConnection</code>
            and <code class="classname">TCPAgentConnection</code>, while the only
            protocol currently implemented is
            <code class="classname">XMLAgentProtocol</code>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><code class="classname">XMLOverTCPAgentTransport</code> sends
            snippets of XML over a TCP network connection. This is the most
            frequently used transport method, so much so that a new class has
            been created to simplify the process of creating this transport
            type. Currently this is the only type of transport used by
            MicaRunner.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp18358696"></a><code class="classname">unsw.cse.mica.agent.Agent</code></h3></div></div></div><p><code class="classname">Agent</code> encapsulates a single autonomous
        unit for doing computation on the blackboard. It is implemented as an
        interface. Implementing an agent consists of writing seven methods;
        and <code class="classname">DefaultAgent</code> provides a reasonable default
        for most of those.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><code class="methodname">setAgentTransport(AgentTransport
            at)</code> and <code class="methodname">getAgentTransport()</code>
            are used so that the agent can redirect calls to the blackboard
            through the appropriate agent. <code class="classname">DefaultAgent</code>
            provides a default for these two methods. In general,
            <code class="methodname">DefaultAgent</code> should be extended, but in
            some cases it is more convenient to implement
            <code class="methodname">Agent</code> so that the agent itself can
            inherit from another class.</p></li><li><p><code class="methodname">init(MicaProperties)</code>: This method
            is called to start the agent operating. It is actually called by
            the <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code> (see the section below).
            Note that the <code class="methodname">init()</code> method should return
            quickly; in particular, the agent transport should not start
            sending messages until <code class="methodname">init()</code> returns. If
            some complicated execution takes place, it should be done in
            another thread. Also note that the <code class="methodname">init()</code>
            method takes a MicaProperties object; these are usually extracted
            from the startup file; but it provides a generic mechanism for
            passing configuration info to the agent.</p></li><li><p><code class="methodname">terminate()</code>: This method is called
            to stop the agent operating. It is typically called by the
            MicaRunner.</p></li><li><p><code class="methodname">handleNewMob(Mob m)</code> This method is
            called whenever a Mob we are registered for arrives.</p></li><li><p><code class="methodname">handleDeletedMob(Mob m)</code> This method
            is called whenever a Mob we are registered for is deleted. The mob
            being deleted is included. This is useful, as this gives us a last
            opportunity to make a local copy of the Mob. If you inherit from
            <code class="methodname">DefaultAgent</code>, there is a default
            implementation that does nothing.</p></li><li><p><code class="methodname">handleTypeManagerChanged()</code> this
            method is called whenever the blackboard's type manager changes.
            The defaul is to do nothing.</p></li></ul></div><p>That's it! At its core, to implement most agents requires
        writing the the <code class="methodname">init</code> and
        <code class="methodname">handleNewMob</code> methods.</p><p><code class="classname">DefaultAgent2</code> provides additional
        functionaliy over <code class="classname">DefaultAgent</code>, including
        transport connection and disconnection, and providing a type manager
        that is kept up-to-date with the blackboard's type manager.
        <code class="classname">GUIAgent</code> extends this further to provide
        skeleton support for an agent needing a GUI. It ensures that
        terminating the agent closes the GUI and vice-versa.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp18368504"></a>Setting up Agents and Agent Transports</h3></div></div></div><p>The following section discusses how agents and agents are set
        up. However, if you use the <code class="classname">MicaRunner</code> tool,
        you need not concern yourself with such details; it handles the
        setting up of agents and agent transports. On first reading, this
        section can be glossed over.</p><p>Because the <code class="classname">Agent</code> and the
        <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code> have a close relationship and
        each can call the other, there are a few special hoops that have to be
        jumped through in order to get them to work together. This is because
        each need to know about the other, so it's tricky to set this up with
        constructors and the like. The steps involved are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Construct the <code class="classname">Agent</code>.</p></li><li><p>Construct the <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code>, but
            ensure one of the parameters is the the Agent constructed in the
            previous step.</p></li><li><p>In the constructor of <code class="classname">AgentTransport</code>
            call the method <code class="methodname">Agent.setTransport(AgentTransport
            at)</code>. This lets the agent know what its transport
            is.</p></li><li><p>When the agent is ready to go, call the method
            <code class="methodname">Agent.init()</code> This is typically the point
            in the code when the agent will connect to the blackboard using,
            say, an <code class="methodname">AgentTransport.connect()</code>
            call.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 4. The MICA implementation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The MICA type system</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
