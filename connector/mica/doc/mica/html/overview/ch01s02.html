      MICA addresses -- storage and communication, are two of the universal
      problems in computer science. To help show how MICA fits in with these
      alternatives, it is compared here with existing systems.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp17624448"></a>MICA as a type of database</h3></div></div></div><p>MICA can be thought of as a database, in fact, to be accurate,
        an object-oriented active database. It is object-oriented, because
        objects can be stored directly in the database, and active, because
        active databases support the execution of code under certain
        conditions when the database changes. When clients write objects to
        the blackboard, this can be thought of as writing a record to a table
        in a database. Similarly for reading, deleting and querying.</p><p>The important difference is the way that MICA conveys
        information about changes to the database to interested third parties;
        who wish to be informed about whatever changes occur to a
        database.</p><p>There are to our knowledge, no active object-oriented databases
        particularly ones that communicate information of changes to the
        database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp18208072"></a>MICA as a Publish/Subscribe Model</h3></div></div></div><p>Another way to think of MICA is as a publish/subscribe model of
        interaction (like the InfoBus architecture), or an Observer pattern in
        languages like Java or as a content-based routing system (such as
        elvin).</p><p>The main difference between MICA and such systems is that MICA
        integrates storage into such an architecture. Though this change seems
        small, it does actually have some significant implications.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp16216312"></a>MICA as a web service and/or RMI and/or RPC</h3></div></div></div><p>The popularity of XML-based web services has increased
        dramatically over the last few years; but really they are examples of
        general remote procedure calls systems.</p><p>The main differences compared to MICA are that these systems are
        "one-way" -- queries are launched by clients to the server, and the
        client gets a response; and secondly, that there is no inherent
        storage capability built in -- though it would be possible to build
        one.</p><p>Having said that, it would be possible to implement MICA as a
        two-way web service. It would be messy, but possible.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp16420240"></a>MICA compared to CORBA</h3></div></div></div><p>CORBA could be used to implement a MICA service; however, CORBA
        is incredibly complex and this would be like implementing a simple
        counter with a Pentium processor. Further, though the protocol
        supports more advanced forms of interaction than the client-server
        protocol mentioned above, such features are rarely implemented in
        CORBA systems.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp18035584"></a>MICA as an agent architecture</h3></div></div></div><p>MICA can be considered a type of agent architecture. Compared to
        most other agent architectures, however, it is much simpler. MICA is
        like an agent architecture where the only elements allowed in the
        agent communication language are objects.</p><p>Having said that, it is easy to interface non-MICA agents to
        MICA. For comparison, we compare it to a popular agent architecture:
        SRI's Open Agent Architecture.</p><p>In many ways, MICA is a simplified form of OAA. MICA could be
        implemented using OAA, but it would be like trying to build a lower
        level abstraction on a higher one -- possible, but for serious work,
        you want a clean implementation. There are also a few other
        differences in security and data model.</p><p>OAA has a "facilitator" agent that manages interaction between
        different agents. In MICA, this is the blackboard manager. OAA uses
        the idea of "solvables"-- things or queries that can be resolved. So
        an agent in OAA says that it provides a certain solvable to the
        facilitator. In MICA, solvables correspond pretty closely to objects.
        In MICA, an agent tells the blackboard to inform it of particular
        objects it is interested in.</p><p>The main differences are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>MICA has no backtracking across agents to solve problems;
            whereas in OAA, you can post compound goals to the facilitator,
            which will then employ depth-first and/or breadth-first search to
            fulfill those goals. For example, in OAA, if you tried to make an
            enquiry like "Get me Bill Smith's manager's phone number" you
            could say:</p><div class="figure"><a name="idp14898376"></a><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">oaa_solve(manager("Bill Smith",M),fax(M,R))</pre></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.1. A typical OAA query</b></p></div><p><br class="figure-break"> (R is the return value here, and M is an
            "intermediate" variable) The "manager" solvable might be handled
            by one agent, and the "fax" solvable might be handled by two
            different agents, each with access to different fax numbers.
            Backtracking would allow this to be done seamlessly.</p></li><li><p>OAA's security model is agent-based; ie. "only the agents I
            specify can use my solvables". MICA's is object-based, i.e. "this
            particular object should not be visible to this agent". The
            blackboard manager in informing agents or responding to their
            queries, has a policy expressed as a function of the agent to
            which the object is to be delivered and the object itself.</p></li><li><p>MICA uses object inheritance to model objects on the
            blackboard; OAA can use any data structure supported by ICL (which
            is basically Prolog).</p></li><li><p>OAA uses "procedural solvables" and "data solvables" -- the
            MICA equivalent for both of these is an Object.</p></li><li><p>OAA specifies four different types of triggers: data
            triggers (tell me fact X), communication triggers (tell me when
            agent X talks to agent Y about Z), timed triggers (tell me every 5
            seconds) and task triggers (tell me when someone wants to do X).
            MICA has one trigger only: tell me when an class X or one of its
            subclasses appears on the blackboard.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 1. Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The manual</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
