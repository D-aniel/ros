    involve different modes of interaction, and different autonomous agents.
    MICA stands for Multimodal Interagent Communication Architecture<sup>[<a name="idp14974840" href="#ftn.idp14974840" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>.</p><p>It is being developed by the Smart Internet Technology CRC. It is
    specifically designed to support the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Write applications in such a way that the application itself
          is separated from the interface to that application; in this way
          different interfaces can be written for different modalities. This
          makes it possible, for instance, to write an e-mail agent; and then
          have both a voice interface and a GUI interface to it at
          once.</p></li><li><p>Having the same information accessible across different
          devices and modalities.</p></li><li><p>Maintainenance of state across different devices and
          modalities so that an interaction started on one device can quickly
          be moved to another.</p></li><li><p>Combinations of both input modalities from various devices and
          output modalities.</p></li><li><p>Support for learning, by exposing the interactions between
          agents so that learning programs can observe them.</p></li></ul></div><p>To support these capabilities, MICA:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Is a platform for exchange of data that is modality and device
        independent;</p></li><li><p>Provides storage of information and state at a single logical
        "access point" (information may be physically distributed but the
        location should be hidden);</p></li><li><p>Requires that communication between agents should be visible to
        learning agents.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp15604176"></a>Basic introduction to Mica</h2></div></div></div><p>MICA uses a blackboard architecture to provide the capabilities
      discussed above. The blackboard concept was introduced by Erman et al
      (1980) in the HEARSAY-II speech understanding system. Since then, it has
      been used in a variety of AI systems and variations of the blackboard
      have been used to provide rendezvous mechanisms in multi-agent
      systems.</p><p>In MICA, we extend the blackboard to support:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>distributed execution;</p></li><li><p>multiple devices;</p></li><li><p>network connection;</p></li><li><p>object-oriented storage;</p></li><li><p>security and privacy.</p></li></ul></div><p>In its simplest form, a blackboard is a shared memory. An agent
      may perform some task and post its results to the blackboard. When data
      of a particular type is written to the blackboard, that event may
      trigger another agent into action and this process repeats. The
      advantage of agents communicating indirectly through the blackboard is
      that they do not have to be aware of each other. This isolation makes it
      possible to introduce new agents or replace existing ones without
      affecting other agents. Furthermore, indirect communication allows the
      information going through the blackboard to be observed by third
      parties, which allows learning and knowledge acquisition.</p><p>In practice, blackboards have more structure than a simple shared
      memory. The memory is often divided into different regions and some
      agents may be restricted to accessing only certain regions. Blackboards
      also commonly include an agenda mechanism for scheduling events.</p><p>In MICA, an object-oriented approach is taken to the blackboard;
      items written to the blackboard have a particular type. Types may be
      inherited.</p><p>The blackboard is structured as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Agents connect to the blackboard.</p></li><li><p>Agents register interests in particular types of
          objects.</p></li><li><p>Agents write objects to the blackboard.</p></li><li><p>The blackboard manager advises registered agents of new
          objects.</p></li><li><p>Agents can search blackboards using a query language (in the
          present implementation, the query language is based on SQL).</p></li></ul></div><p>Generally, there are several types of agents: <span class="emphasis"><em>interface
      agents</em></span>, which provide a way of interacting with the system's
      user, <span class="emphasis"><em>computation agents</em></span> that provide services such
      as e-mail, or text-to-speech and <span class="emphasis"><em>environment agents</em></span>
      that report information about the user's context, e.g. GPS trackers.
      There is no formal distinction made between these types of agents, but
      it goes some way to showing the variety of different systems that can be
      connected to MICA.</p><p>The blackboard provides two important functions: information
      storage -- by writing information to the blackboard; and information
      communication -- by informing other agents when objects are written to
      the blackboard. The fact that they are both done using the same
      mechanism has several advantages. It means that, for example, a GPS
      tracker can report information to the blackboard, even if no one is
      listening, and later agents can "track back" through older location
      information. Agents that connect to a discussion "late" can retrieve
      state from before they connected. Agents can also "watch" the blackboard
      and contribute to the information on the blackboard -- e.g. learning
      agents.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.idp14974840" href="#idp14974840" class="para">1</a>] </sup>Actually, this is the latest version of the acronym. Previously
