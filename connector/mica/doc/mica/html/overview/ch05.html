    basics of writing a MICA agent. This chapter includes a walkthrough of the
    MICA-related code that is in <code class="classname">SharedPad</code>.</p><p>SharedPad allows any number of connected agents to share a single
    notepad and to draw on it using a mouse and/or stylus. Anything drawn on
    one shared pad is shared amongst the other pads. In addition, state is
    preserved, so that even if every shared pad disconnects, all the
    information is kept.</p><p>SharedPad uses a single type of Mob:
    <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code>. As previously discussed, it has four
    fields that represent the start and end points of a line:</p><p>As mentioned previously, there are two interesting methods that need
    to be implemented for an agent: <code class="methodname">init()</code> and
    <code class="methodname">handleMob()</code>. <code class="methodname">init()</code> is
    called -- typically by <code class="methodname">main()</code> to start the
    agent.</p><div class="figure"><a name="idp18415280"></a><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">public void init(MicaProperties mp) throws MicaException {
  at.connect("sharedPad");
  List existingLines
    = at.mobSearch("select m from m in sharedPadLine;");
  for(Iterator i = existingLines.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
    drawSharedLine((Mob) i.next());
  }
  at.register("sharedPadLine");
}</pre></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.1. The <code class="methodname">init()</code> method for
      <code class="classname">SharedPad</code></b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The first thing that the agent does is connect to the blackboard. To
    do this, it uses <code class="methodname">at</code>, which is a field that stores
    the agent transport. By calling
    <code class="methodname">at.connect("sharedPad")</code>, the agent connects to
    the blackboard and requests that it should be called sharedPad.</p><p>Once connected, we query for all existing lines on the blackboard.
    This is useful, since if someone has already started drawing, it allows
    the retrieval of existing doodles. The query uses MicaQL, a simple query
    language. The above statement says: get all objects m from the blackboard,
    whose type is sharedPadLine. For each mob, we then use the method
    <code class="methodname">drawSharedLine()</code> to draw it.
    <code class="methodname">drawSharedLine()</code> is outlined below.</p><p>Finally, once we have obtained all the existing data, we now
    register for any new <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code> mobs that are
    written to the blackboard, using the
    <code class="methodname">at.register()</code> call.</p><p>The above method called <code class="methodname">drawSharedLine()</code>,
    which is used to actually draw it on to the screen.</p><div class="figure"><a name="idp18419720"></a><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">public void drawSharedLine(Mob m) {
  drawnLines.add(m);
  int startX = m.getSlot1AsInt("oldX"));
  int startY = m.getSlot1AsInt("oldY"));
  int endX =  m.getSlot1AsInt("newX"));
  int endY =  m.getSlot1AsInt("newY"));
  Graphics g = getGraphics();
  g.drawLine(startX, startY, endX, endY);
}</pre></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.2. The <code class="methodname">drawSharedLine()</code> method for
      <code class="classname">SharedPad</code></b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><p><code class="methodname">drawSharedLine()</code> is an example of how the
    information stored in a mob can be extracted and used. Firstly, the mob is
    added to a list of drawn lines -- this isn't for any reason related to the
    blackboard, but simply so that if our sharedPad window gets covered by
    other GUI applications we can do an redraw easily. The next four lines
    extract data from the mob; each converting it into an integer. Note that
    we use <code class="methodname">getSlot1AsInt()</code> in this case, since we
    only want one value for each slot and we want it to be returned as an
    integer. Finally we obtain the graphics context and draw the line based on
    the information we extracted from the mob.</p><p>The other major method an agent must define is
    <code class="methodname">handleNewMob()</code>.</p><div class="figure"><a name="idp18422776"></a><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">public void handleNewMob(Mob m) {
  if(m.getType().equals("sharedPadLine")){
    drawSharedLine(m);
  }
}</pre></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.3. The <code class="methodname">handleMob()</code> method for
      <code class="classname">SharedPad</code></b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The code first checks to see if the type of the received mob is a
    <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code>. Strictly speaking this is
    unnecessary, since <code class="classname">sharedPadLines</code> are the only type
    that is registered for. Once a new <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code> is
    received, it is drawn, just like the lines that were retrieved from the
    blackboard initially.</p><p>All the functionality now required to implement the drawing of lines
    already on the blackboard is now complete. This code is now sufficient
    (together with the supporting Swing and Java boilerplate code) for
    implementing a passive sharedPad that watches while other sharedPad agents
    connected to the blackboard draw. What remains is the functionality to
    write to the blackboard.</p><p>This is implemented by having sharedPad object have a
    <code class="classname">MouseDragListener</code>. Every time the mouse is dragged,
    it calls the following newLine() method:</p><div class="figure"><a name="idp18426240"></a><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">public void newLine(int oldX, int oldY, int newX, int newY) {
  Mob m = new Mob("sharedPadLine");
  m.addSlot("oldX", String.valueOf(oldX));
  m.addSlot("oldY", String.valueOf(oldY));
  m.addSlot("newX", String.valueOf(newX));
  m.addSlot("newY", String.valueOf(newY));
  at.writeMob(m);
}</pre></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.4. The <code class="methodname">newLine()</code> method for
      <code class="classname">SharedPad</code></b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The parameters passed to <code class="methodname">newLine()</code> are used
    to construct the appropriate mob. For each of the four values, we add a
    slot, and set the value of the slot to a string value. Finally, once it is
    all finished; the newly constructed mob is written to the blackboard
    through the agent transport <code class="classname">at</code>.</p><p>Once all these components have been put together, with the remainder
    of the Swing code; we now have an Agent that can share information and
    retain state. As can be seen, the code is relatively simple.</p><p>One interesting note is that a given
    <code class="classname">SharedPad</code> does not have a concept of a "local" and
    "remote" line; so much so that when a user drags the mouse, a line is not
    drawn locally; instead the agent just listens for generic
    <code class="classname">sharedPadLine</code> mobs, some of which may have been its
    own! It would be possible to immediately draw a line as soon as the mouse
    is dragged and then ignore mobs which was created by the agent itself;
    indeed, this would lead to the user experiencing a "snappier" response.
    This was not done in this case for two reasons: (a) it would complicate
    the code, (b) it is useful to experience the "round-trip time" of going to
    and from the blackboard to decide if MICA is suitable for "real-time"
    interaction.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Configuring MICA </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 6. A collection of clients: the mail reading application</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
